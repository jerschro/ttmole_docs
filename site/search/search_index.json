DONE have textbox pop up if needed, so you can copy and paste to the terminal     - DONE add file name to title of editor window     -DONE change the no atom loaded text on scroll text to something more professional     - NOT NECESSARY ATM maybe add bool logic to init functions so if return False then something went wrong in the init()     - when I distribute, i will just email the .exe file, settings.json, and README.md, and LICENSE file (might load to git hub)</p> <p>DONE If curr_atom is emptymolecule, be able to add molecule to nothing     -

if I want to automate adding adsorbate, I could find center of gravity, I could move to center of unit cell x,y and then z move above highest surface model     -also when you import a molecule, scroll list will automatically select the new molecule.      -DONE If xyz adsorbent file, need to convert to ABCMolecule coords     -DONE If no adsorbent file is chosen, then have a popup that lists the loaded information and you can         choose which atoms are the adsorbent.     -DONE Can acheive the first two by creating an object/class that stores/converts adsorbent to type of         surface and then you can modify the adsorbent in relation to the surface.     -DONE Also has an update button/updates the Matplotlib visualizer feed base off of changes from         the user.     -DONE Save button to save and writes the current configuration to the textbox in the format of the surface file.     -NOT_WANTED Close button and then popup that asks do you want to save file with filesave dialog popup     -MAYBE NEEDED add popup menu when converting xyz to Vasp     -NOT NEEDED prob not. use typechecker strict for bestcodepractices     - FOR NEB:         - have a view where you load a beginning and a final image and then click through each atom          to see if it is the same one or different one.     -KINDA DONE(Only adding 2 vasp files if they have equal unitcelll)         If Vasp adsorbent file, need to create a function that will take the ABCMolecule object and convert         it to the different (larger) unitcell with same lattice matrix as the surface     - make it resizable. Would need a key binding for resizability.     -NEXT TO DO:::: MAKE SETTINGS SCREEN so that I can start to change settings during the code running.         - will make sense on where to import new absorbent, color themes, maybe how atoms are rotated,          rule on moving molecules in vasp greater than 1 or negative,      -still need to update on matplot when you check the button on scroll list     -*create clipboard window. Will need while loop until window is closed to load into editor.         - popup will have textbox and dropdown with options of full file, vasp coords or xyz coords.         - have submit button where it will close window and return as Molecule type.     - DONE When Zero Text, error appears. Might need to make NoneTypeText so no error     - Theres a bug with validating xdatcar and xyz animation files.     - Matplotlib visualizer Vasp unit cell     - The first undo of the file deletes the file and doesn't remember the change (gotta be something with TKINTER)     - DONE menubar color changes when settings dialog opens     - DONE with listing in MoleculeLister     - popup windows are behind parent windows...     - DONE when import a new file, scroll list needs to be updated also     - rotate function in .xyz works. Rotate function in .vasp does not really work     -with comparison of molecules, need to add eq or str or repr in all molecule classes         in order to compare and know if one has changed or not. right now im not sure what is happening when two          molecules are being compared.</p> <p>python -m PyInstaller main.py --onefile --windowed Dependencies (not from standard library):     - Matplotlib     - customtkinter     - tkinter     - numpy     - pyautogui     - maybe periodictable</p>"},{"location":"versions/","title":"Versions","text":"<p>Listed in the table are TTMolE Versions</p> Name Date Description 1.0.0 Feburary 18, 2024 First compilied version (attempted to distribute) 1.0.1-win Feburary 27, 2024 Windows compilied again (not distributed) 1.0.1-linux March 11, 2024 linux edits for HPCC (loaded on HPCC for a while) 1.0.2 March 24, 2024 Compilied for windows and distributed on HPCC 1.0.3 Current Version description"}]}
